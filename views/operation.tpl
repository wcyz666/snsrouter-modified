<h1> Operations </h1>

<p>
Most of the following operations are executed periodically in a backend thread.
Users usually do not have to execute them manually. 
They are here to react to special demand, 
e.g. after changing the configs, reload them and trigger weight adapation. 
</p>

<h2> Reload Config </h2>


<h2> Weight Training </h2>

<ul>
	<li>

	</a>
	When weights are changed, new incoming messages will be scored using new weights. 
	However, score of old messages is stored in DB. 
	This operation refreshes score of old messages up to a certain age (1 day by default). 
	<b>Please wait until result is returned to the frame below. </b>
	Age is parameterized in the URL. 
	It should be the same as the age used in "ranked_hometimeline".
