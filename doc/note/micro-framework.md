## bobo

Now is not then. 

Documentation is limited. 

Strange '@' sign notation. I only see this in "@staticmethod" before. 

20121027: This is decorator. 
There is a awesome tutorial on Stackoverflow.

## cherrypy

config is difficult? 

## web.py

## bottle

```
run(...)
```

least lines and characters to implement the speaker's demo app. 

## itty

similar to bottle. 

What's this? Figure it out later. 

```
@get('/')
def ...
```

least framework line count. 

## flask

Not good documentation. 

Not clearly where request come from. 

Interactive debugging? 

## pesto

## werkzeug

raise redirected. 

## aspen.io

raise response. 

dir layout. 

run aspen in the directory. 

## Remarks

I can get only a little information from this talk. 
I lack certain background. 

Combine the information I have, I think bottle may be my starting point. 

Asking questions on stackoverflow really saves time. 
At least, I get to know the "micro-framework". 
Or otherwise, I will spend more time in setting up the server, and writing app.
